# Simple jQuery sections slider

This is a very simple implementation of the sections slider in jQuery.

Try it live on this [demo](https://epranka.github.io/sections-slider)

Yes, it is very basic. It can be greatly improved, but it just an example how fast it can be implemented. If you need a full-featured slider, use this awesome library [fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/) by [Alvaro Trigo](https://twitter.com/IMAC2)
